Region of interest, trackbar values (working good values):
width top     : 102
height top    : 160
width bottom  : 20
height bottom : 240

====================
White Color for lane:
    hsv:0-179, 0-21, 0-255  [working] 
    [Here the first portion of saturation is logical I think. 
    Also, the last half of hue and very last portion of value is required. ]
    
for dark room, Tanvir's table lamp only:
    hsv:30-179, 0-80, 0-255

====================
When used:
    1. Robot from gpiozero
    2. Raspberry Pi 3
    3. 18650 for plastic gear motor
Then for single move:
    min_turn_speed = 0.4  # less than 0.4 and motor stalls
    turn_duration = 0.0   # though it is 0, it works and in very small increments.

    min_forward_speed = 0.5  # maybe not the minimum, but enough
    forward_duration = 0.1   # 0.1 works better than 0.0
