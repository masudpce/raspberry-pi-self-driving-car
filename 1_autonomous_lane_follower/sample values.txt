Region of interest, trackbar values (working good values):
width top     : 102
height top    : 160
width bottom  : 20
height bottom : 240

white:
    hsv:0-179, 0-21, 0-255  [working] [here the first portion of saturation is logical I think. Also, the last half of hue and very last portion of value is required. ]
    
for dark room, Tanvir's table lamp only:
    hsv:30-179, 0-80, 0-255
