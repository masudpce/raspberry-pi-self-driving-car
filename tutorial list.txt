1. Lane Detection
    a. Histogram Method
        i.  No details given. Tested - didn't work out of the box. Written for python2. Requires overhauling to even continue.
            [software: no OpenCV required, uses picamera library for camera, brown colored threads are used as lane marking. Code copied from GitHub. ]

        ii. Murtaza course. Very detailed and up-to-date
            [software: Uses OpenCV. Lane is white paper. No GitHub available for it. Code copied from course page.]
            [hardware: uses two different power source: power bank for pi, 2pc 18650 for motors]

    b. Canny-Hough transformation
        i.  Simple, illustrated with servo and picture. NO details given about how it works.
            Uses picamera, OpenCV.
            Need to inspect how it works in details and compare with others.

        ii. Written and described tutorial for pi

        iii. No motor control, no pi. Just lane detection

2. Traffic light (aka color ball Detection)
    a. Guzunty piter from magpi tutorial aka symbol finder
